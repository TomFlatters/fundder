Some info relevant to features regarding payments



Test the integration

By this point you should have an integration that:

Collects and saves card details without charging the customer by using a SetupIntent
Charges the card off-session and has a recovery flow to handle declines and authentication requests
There are several test cards you can use to make sure this integration is ready for production. Use them with any CVC, postal code, and future expiration date.
